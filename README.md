# Automated_Security_System
Recently, surveillance programs are gaining popularity. The government, various organizations,  civil society organizations, etc., use these systems to evaluate various activities for safety and  security purposes. So, with increased demand for security, video-based surveillance has become  an important area for research. CCTV camera system is a very popular method of keeping a  building or a place under surveillance. In Conventional security systems, the cameras only record  and stream the video feed so that someone can watch what happened in that place at that time.  But it can’t prevent a burglary or can’t immediately alert the authorities. In this project we  proposed system to identify any individual in an institutional building from real time video  surveillance footage. This method works on different level of lighting conditions with IP cameras  already installed in the building without any significant error. We have implemented this project  with python libraries like OpenCV, PIL, and numPY. This system is designed to Monitor,  Identify, Record, and detect faces. This system will keep log data of the whereabouts of all the  individuals on real time. A software system is also developed to facilitate the admin to access the  system properly with the help of Python GUI – tkinter.
